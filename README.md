# gcode-speedvis
gcode speed visualizer

get an example gcode file from here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qYY2SrTM_M

modify the vp.py to open that file and let it run. Outputs will be written to capture folder as PNGs.

This is just a quick ~1hour hack written while watching crappy TV shows, so this is by no means optimzed, bug-free, polished or user-friendly. No commandline interface integrated, yet.

Requires Python 2.7 and pygame (and opt. mencoder). At least worked once on Debian Linux.

capture2video.sh just runs mencoder with some parms to commbine the PNGs to an avi.


Have fun :D
